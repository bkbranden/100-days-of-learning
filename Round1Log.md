# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned and took notes on the basics of the web, networks, and HTML

**Thoughts:** Was pretty boring since I knew most of the material, but I learned some more interesting details on anchor tags such as having mailto: protocols and how to point to something within the page by prepending "#". Also I was able to soldify my understanding of very basic HTML forms.
