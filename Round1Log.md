# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dove deeper into more of CSS and beefing up my foundations with CSS. Today, I reviewed over things like the display and tables. I finally understand what the use of "floats" were in respect CSS Grid and Flexbox. Also, learned exactly what the different values in positioning do and messed around with some of them.

**Thoughts:** Some of the information that I review is actually very helpful and covers things that I did not know previously. Things like how floats work and what they are used for were some examples of things I didn't really understand about CSS, but have been cleared up.

### Day 3: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished reviewing the basics of CSS including how to add resources such as images, pseudo elements, Units, calc(), etc. and started diving into the box model of CSS

**Thoughts:** Again this reviewing is very refreshing since the majority of my understanding of CSS was based on just trying things and trying to make it work in context of the project that I was working on. Reviewing this, there are somethings that I learned such as using the viewport height and width as well as the units for lengths. Furthermore, reviewing the foundational concepts such as how the box model works will be very beneficial when I get to reviewing CSS grids and the flex-box model.

### Day 2: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started cracking CSS rules and selectors

**Thoughts:** Reviewing the CSS from the basics is a good foundational cover for me. Again like HTML, there are a lot of information that I had already knew, but I learned some bits of information that I was previously unaware of such as how the Cascading works on CSS styling, Attribute Selectors, and how pseudo-class selectors work.

### Day 1: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned and took notes on the basics of the web, networks, and HTML

**Thoughts:** Was pretty boring since I knew most of the material, but I learned some more interesting details on anchor tags such as having mailto: protocols and how to point to something within the page by prepending "#". Also I was able to soldify my understanding of very basic HTML forms.
